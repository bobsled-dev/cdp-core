# DUBBD Roadmap for CDP Core

[DUBBD](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf-package-big-bang) does not currently support the CDP Core target environment. This folder contains the customizations required to support the CDP Core target environment. Once supported, this folder will be removed. in favor of some configuration in the [../zarf-config.yaml](../zarf-config.yaml) file.
